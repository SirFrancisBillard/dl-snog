hello

i am little bit drink when i make thos so forgive me :()

these are song i make and some sound effect

they are all name random because i am austisitism

therre are many more of my soundcloud(s): https://soundcloud.com/sir-francis-billard

thanks you

some context:

"guit1 trap remix" is based off a song from a video game, "guit1.wav"
you can probably find it from just googling, but its "op.120 Rossiniana 2"﻿ by Mauro Giuliani

"bumble 2" is a remix (cover?) of humble by ken-dick lame-ar

most of the album covers are racist because i am racist
the "Chicken Factory" art is from when i used to make shitty hardbass (hence the 2016 fidget spinner)
"semen days" is a parody of "demon days"
"big kid, f.A.A.t shitty" is a parody of "good kid, m.A.A.d city"

"mccaren.wav" is isolated audio of the whistle from pump up kick

"fountain of life v2" is an orthodox christian chant that i originally used in a game for a crusade level
(i know the orthodox never crusaded, it just sounded fitting)

"phase" uses a shepard tone in its bassline


other inspiration:
down under remix - welcome to the party by lil pump
debt grits - yeah im riding through the area
pianer - paper please win theme
reel - drunk again by reel big fish*
chlorine milk - https://soundcloud.com/xahoy/nuclear-fruit-theme
la perve - le perv by carpenter brut*
heateat - warriors by imagine dragon*
still bill - still DRE
inlave - in love by fear of pop*
f.A.A.t shitty - m.A.A.d city (thonk)

*sounds nothing like the inspiration
